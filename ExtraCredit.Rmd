## R Markdown

```{r patient-inflammation}
summary(data01)
```

#plot for the avg_day_inflammation

```{r patient_1, echo=FALSE}
plot(avg_day_inflammation)
```

#plot for the avg_patient_inflammation

```{r}
summary(avg_patient_inflammation)
```

#max_day_inflammation

#min_day_inflammation

#r_novice_inflammation












Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
